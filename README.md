This repository contains a data cleaning project focused on the Nashville housing dataset. The main goal of this project is to preprocess and clean the dataset, making it more suitable for analysis and further use. The cleaning steps were performed using SQL queries.

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: Structured Query Language was used for data manipulation and cleaning tasks. 

## Data Cleaning Methods

- **Standardize Date Format**: Utilized SQL's `CONVERT` function to standardize date formats.
- **Populate Property Address NULLs**: Applied SQL skills for data population using `ISNULL` function and joining tables.
- **Breaking out Address into Individual Columns**: Employed SQL's string manipulation functions for splitting addresses.
- **Parsing Owner Address**: Demonstrated skills in using string parsing functions like `PARSENAME` and `REPLACE`.
- **Change 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No'**: Showcased conditional logic in SQL for value transformation.
- **Remove Duplicates**: Utilized window functions and `ROW_NUMBER()` for identifying and handling duplicates.
- **Delete Unused Columns**: Executed SQL's `ALTER TABLE` command to drop unnecessary columns.

## Conclusion

This data cleaning project demonstrates various SQL methods for enhancing this dataset. SQL skills such as window functions, string manipulation, and conditional logic were effectively employed. These cleaned data are now ready for analysis, modeling, or other purposes.
